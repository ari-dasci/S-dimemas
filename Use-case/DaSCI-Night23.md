## DaSCI science activities, September 2023
DaSCI has participated in this event from each of our sites in Granada, Jaen and Cordoba. In particular, with the 7 activities in Granada, the present use case of the DIME+ tool is conformed.

- Nature, an inspiration for Artificial Intelligence. With correspondence to A1 alternative.
- SintonIA: AI on the radio. With correspondence to A2 alternative.
- Building the Future: The Power of the Digital Twin in Buildings. With correspondence to A3 alternative.
- Automated Planning, or how AI also worries about the future.
- An app to evaluate science outreach events: DIME+.
- Your skull sounds familiar.
- Artificial Intelligence: between myth and reality.

### The model 
The DIME+ approach uses a dynamic set of dimensions, which configure the evaluation criteria. This information, together with the scales that can be used to provide the linguistic responses are set in the backend.
Citizens after the talks use the DIME+ app (available in English and Spanish) to make ratings, which include the use of 'opinion sentiment', 'hesitant opinion', as well as, 'relative importance'.

### Results
The backend provides organizers with access to the results report. These are in open format for download by anyone interested. Download URL: https://dime.everyware.es/index.php?r=site%2Fexport-evaluations&eventId=17&subeventIds=[122,127,128,129,130,131,132]
