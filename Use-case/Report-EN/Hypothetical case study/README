In this folder you will find the report in English of the evaluations obtained in the test activities. These test activities are used to display the report per project. 
The elements that make up the report by project are similar to those shown by event, the only change is the presentation of the information grouped by events:
• Statistical data of the project's evaluations. Number of attendees and age ranges.
• Final satisfaction of the Project given in a unified language label in S_13.
• Collective evaluations of each event and its projects in three scenarios: Pessimistic, Optimistic and Combined. These ratings are also given in unified language tags in S_13.
• Collective evaluations by dimension, by event and activities. Also with unified linguistic tags in S_13.
• Quantitative collective assessment of events and their activities based on the rankings generated by the indices of the Citizen Crowd Decision Making (CCDM) model. The rankings are presented in the three scenarios: Pessimistic, Optimistic and Combined.
• The result of a survey at the end of the ratings of each event and its activities.
