In this folder you will find the report in English of the evaluations obtained in the activities:
• An app to evaluate popular science events: DIME+
• Nature, an inspiration for Artificial Intelligence.
• Artificial Intelligence: Between Myth and Reality.
• SintonIA: AI on the radio.
• Building the Future: The Power of the Digital Twin in Buildings.
• Automatic Planning, or how AI also cares about the future.
• Your skull sounds familiar.
The report is created from the evaluations given to the seven activities that make up the Night23-Granada event. 
The elements that make up the report are
Statistical data of the event's ratings. Number of attendees and age ranges.
Final satisfaction of the event given in a unified language tag in S_13.
Collective assessments in three scenarios: Pessimistic, Optimistic and Combined. These ratings are also given in unified language tags in S_13.
Collective valuations by dimension. Also, with unified linguistic tags in S_13.
Quantitative collective assessment based on the rankings generated by the indices of the Citizen Crowd Decision Making (CCDM) model. The rankings are presented in the three scenarios: Pessimistic, Optimistic and Combined.
The result of a survey at the end of the evaluations, this data is given by activities.

Unified Language Tags: You have three sets of input. Citizen experts can choose the one they feel best represents their opinion. Each assessment of each event can be given on a different scale, even if it is the same expert evaluating different activities. 
The sets of input language tags with which the activities were assessed are:
S_3 = {little, normal, a lot}. 
S_5 = {little, normal, quite, a lot}
S_7 = {Nothing, poor, fair, normal, very, very, very, impressive}.
The set of linguistic tags that encompass the input sets is:
S_13 = {Terrible, Nothing, Very poor, Poor, Sufficient, Average, Good, A Lot, Quite a Lot, Satisfied, Very Satisfied, Excellent, Impressive}
