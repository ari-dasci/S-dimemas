## DIME+ Interface

The design of DIME+ makes it intuitive to use, menus and buttons are visible and easy to identify. This section shows some elements of the website which you can consult at the following URL www.dimemas-ugr.es/.

1 The >>front-end<< shows the main page of the DIME+ website, where you can consult information about events and activities.

3 The choice and/or creation of the linguistic scales can be seen in the image >>config-scales<<. In this section the organisers can personalise the scales (of linguistic term set with several granularities) with which the users give their opinion about satisfaction with event's activities.
